# Game Dev
## Unity UI:
Scene view - Main window for editing game/level
Game view - What the player sees
Hierarchy - List of every GameObject in your scene
Inspector - Details about selected GameObject
Project - File explorer for all the assets in your game
Console - Debugging console

## Unity Specific programming:
void Start() - Called whenever a GameObject is created or the game starts
void Update() - Called once every frame
Time.deltaTime - Time between last Update() call, use to make things framerate-independent
Make things public to see them/edit them in the inspector!
Try your best not to use GetComponent<>() or GameObject.Find() every frame, set them once!

## Multi-User development:
Use a good .gitignore, see https://github.com/Centribo/Useful-Unity-Assets/blob/master/.gitignore
Use a good .gitattributes, see https://github.com/Centribo/Useful-Unity-Assets/blob/master/.gitattributes
Never work on the same scene as someone else at the same time and try to merge!

## General Game Development:
Think small, your idea is probably already too big!
Build the core of your game first, then build features on top.
If you need an idea for a game, think of classic arcade games and add your own twist
ALWAYS BE PLAYTESTING!
