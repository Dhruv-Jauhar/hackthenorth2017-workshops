# Virtual Reality Workshop

**VR &amp; Unity**
- Native support on Windows for Unity 5.3+
- Oculus plugin required for Mac, with Unity 5.1f.1

Unity provides 3 essential elements to creating VR applications: 3D graphics, sound, interaction.

Through its scripting language, developers can define behaviour for in-game objects.

**Graphics Programming**
- 3D Models consist of a mesh of triangles that defines their shape, and textures that define their colour.
- The scene-graph defines the parent-child relationship of all of the objects in the scene. Parents pass their frame of reference down to their children.
- To move an object around in 3D space, you can translate, rotate, or scale it.

**Types of VR Applications**
How can VR add value to the application?

- Presence / Immersiveness
- 3D Interaction

Example: interior design - moving around furniture can be made much easier in VR!

**Assets**
Any file used in your application is typically called an asset. These can include 3D models, sound files, or textures.

Software to create 3D models includes Houdini, Maya, Blender, Sketchup, and many more. Sound files can be edited using tools like audacity.

**Interfaces &amp; Interaction**
Always remember the screen is the user&#39;s portal into your virtual world. Therefore, things like scale, what you see when you look down, and movement are important!

Depending on what your hardware has support for, you can have different kinds of interaction:

- Gaze
- Controller
- Position

Interaction that feels like real life can make the experience feel more immersive.

**Final Thoughts**
- Playtesting with other hackers is a valuable source of feedback!
- VR apps are a lot of fun to build!
