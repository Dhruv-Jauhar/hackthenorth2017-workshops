## Imposter Syndrome
- What is Imposter Syndrome?
  - The idea that you don&#39;t belong in your program / workplace because you are a fraud
- This is important to talk about because if left unchecked imposter syndrome can destroy your self-confidence leaving you in a worse place than when you started
- Who is to blame?
  - This has become very widespread in our culture
  - Cannot blame one thing alone, but common suspects include:
    - Social media leading people to think life is better than normal
    - People using accomplishments to determine self worth
    - Goal oriented society
- Strategies to combat:
  - Time
    - If you think your a fraud and don&#39;t belong then wait and check that claim
    - If you don&#39;t think you are fit to be an engineer but graduate then your claim was wrong
  - Detaching accomplishments from self worth
    - You are worth more than the sum of your degree and accomplishments
    - Self-worth needs to come from within not outside
  - Learning to detach others from yourself
    - Be happy when people succeed but don&#39;t let it crush your own self confidence

Self Care

- No one can take better care of you than you!
- Without proper self care you mental health will suffer when times of stress come along
- Having good mental health is like having a sturdy ship, when harsh winds come you are not broken
- Stopping the &quot;Who has it worse&quot; completions
  - Stop glorifying bad self-care
  - If someone says they only slept 2 hours last night, an effective response is not &quot;oh I only slept 1&quot; a good response is &quot;you should really get more sleep&quot;
